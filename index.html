        <div class="subheading mb-5">Biochemistry with a medical emphasisüî¨</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4"><br>Hello! I am a 19 year old Chinese Vietnamese American, who was born in the San Gabriel Valley. I then moved to Pomona Valley, which is where I spent the rest of my childhood. I graduated from Diamond Bar High School and am now a second year student at the University of California, Riverside. I am a pre-health student studying biochemistry with a medical emphasis. I am involved in a sorority called Alpha Delta Pi, as well as a cultural organization on campus called Vietnamese Student Association. My sorority‚Äôs philanthropy is the Ronald McDonald House of Charities. We have a local house in Loma Linda, and my sisters and I often visit to help bake and cook for these families, clean up for them, and just overall spend time with them. This year, I picked up two little diamonds. As their big, I am their ADPi mentor, older sister, and best friend all in one! Alpha Delta Pi until I die<br><br>

        Vietnamese Student Association is the largest organization on our campus. Our members do not have to be Vietnamese to join, however, we do focus and celebrate Vietnamese culture. We have an event called ACE week, where new members can find an ‚ÄúAn‚Äù or ‚ÄúChi‚Äù which means older brother or older sister. This event promotes our club‚Äôs aspect of family. We also have an event called Vietnamese Culture Night, where we perform Vietnamese skits, songs, and even dances. I am actually VSA‚Äôs Social Chair this year, and last year I was one of nineteen VSA‚Äôs interns. As their Social Chair, I am in charge of organizing fundraising events, clubbing events, and our winter and spring retreats. Due to COVID-19, clubbing events and our retreats have unfortunately been cancelled<br><br>

        As for my career, the medical field has always been something I wanted to pursue, however I get queasy at the thought of needles and blood. Therefore, I began looking into other medical careers that are not doctors or surgeons. Pharmacy was the one that stuck with me after all these years. So ever since my sophomore year of high school, I have always wanted to be a pharmacist. As an aspiring pharmacist, I am currently working at Walgreens pharmacy to gain the hours and experience required to take the PTCB. Passing the PTCB allows me to officially work as a Pharmacy Technician! Once I graduate from UC Riverside, I plan on going to pharmacy school to further my education! Some schools I have looked into include Western University, in Pomona, and Chapman, located in Orange.
